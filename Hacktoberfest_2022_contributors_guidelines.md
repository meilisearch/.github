# Hacktoberfest 2022 contributors guidelines

Just as we’re getting ready for the Hacktoberfest 2022 hype, allow us to remind you of a few guidelines to follow to ensure the event goes smoothly for everyone. These guidelines support the existing ones available on [Hacktoberfest's official website] (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources).

📜 Hacktoberfest is an intense time for both organizers and participants. To optimize time and ensure we get to your PR without delay, we won’t focus on PRs that don’t meet the [quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam) shared on this year’s Hacktoberfest website. The significant number of entries will force us to prioritize our tasks as we hope to review our contributors’ hard work as much as possible.

🔍 To respect our team's work and the time they invest in reviewing your contributions, please ensure you incorporate all the feedback they have offered before asking for additional feedback. If any of the comments they share are unclear, please feel free to ask for clarification. Our team won't re-review a PR that doesn't consider the initial feedback during the revision.

⏰ We couldn’t be more pleased to see a high number of contributions! We kindly request your patience with us; we will focus on reviewing your PRs from Monday to Thursday, during working hours, CEST time. If you’re outside this time zone, please don’t panic; we will get to yours soon.

👑 October is a special time to celebrate the open source community and its contributors; coding contributions are more than welcome. Non-coding contributions will be right at home in the [Awesome Meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/awesome-meilisearch) repo. Documentation PRs will not be opened this time around, as we feel like Hacktoberfest might not be the most relevant time of the year for them.

🚅 As it can happen sometimes, people ask to be assigned specific issues but never get back. This discourages other contributors from opening PRs to fix the issue. To avoid this situation, we do not assign PRs to people. We will accept and merge the first PR that correctly fixes and implements the issue following our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-dotnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you know there’s a specific issue you really want to work on; we can only encourage you to get to it as soon as possible and do your best! 

We can’t wait to review your PRs!
